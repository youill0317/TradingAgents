"""Portfolio Manager: synthesises the risk-analyst debate into the final decision.

Uses LangChain's ``with_structured_output`` so the LLM produces a typed
``PortfolioDecision`` directly, in a single call.  The result is rendered
back to markdown for storage in ``final_trade_decision`` so memory log,
CLI display, and saved reports continue to consume the same shape they do
today.  When a provider does not expose structured output, the agent falls
back gracefully to free-text generation.

**Rating Scale** (use exactly one):
- **Buy**: Strong conviction to enter or add to position
- **Overweight**: Favorable outlook, gradually increase exposure
- **Hold**: Maintain current position, no action needed
- **Underweight**: Reduce exposure, take partial profits
- **Sell**: Exit position or avoid entry

**Context:**
- Research Manager's investment plan: **{research_plan}**
- Trader's transaction proposal: **{trader_plan}**
{lessons_line}
**Risk Analysts Debate History:**
{history}

**Relevant Public Data Evidence:**
{public_data_for_agent(state, "ticker_review")}

---

Ground every conclusion in specific evidence from the analysts. Commit to a directional call only when the evidence clearly supports one; choose Hold when the case is balanced, materially conflicting, ambiguous, or insufficient to justify changing exposure, rather than forcing a direction to appear decisive. Weigh the analysts on their merits, independent of speaking order.

Data sufficiency is separate from that rating: if core issuer facts are unavailable, explicitly state that the assessment requires review. Do not describe missing evidence as a balanced or neutral investment case. Retain exact official observation IDs in your numerical reasoning and cite both endpoints for comparisons.
